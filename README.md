Project Description

Image Recognition Using CNN on CIFAR-10 Dataset

This project aims to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify images in the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset is a popular computer vision dataset containing 60,000 color images of 10 classes of objects, with 6,000 images per class.

The project will involve the following steps:

Data preprocessing: The CIFAR-10 dataset will be preprocessed to normalize the images and split them into training, validation, and test sets.
Model architecture: A CNN model will be designed and implemented using Python and a deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Model training: The CNN model will be trained on the training set using the Adam optimizer and the cross-entropy loss function.
Model evaluation: The trained CNN model will be evaluated on the validation and test sets to assess its performance.
Model deployment: The trained CNN model will be deployed as a web service or a mobile app so that it can be used to classify images in real time.
Expected Outcomes

The expected outcomes of this project are:

A trained CNN model that can classify images in the CIFAR-10 dataset with high accuracy.
A web service or mobile app that uses the trained CNN model to classify images in real time.
